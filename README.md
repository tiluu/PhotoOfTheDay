#photoOftheDay

Location based #photooftheday using Instagram API
I found it difficult to search for a specific hashtag based on location. Most searches done in Instagram can only return reuslts based location or hashtag but not both.  So using the Instagram API, I combined the location endpoints and tag endpoints, to filter through results to only display #photooftheday in various cities.
